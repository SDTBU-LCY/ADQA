# ADQA: Hierarchical Visual Information Extraction and Knowledge Graph-Based Reasoning for System Architecture Diagram Question Answering
Current visual question answering research on structured diagrams primarily targets flowcharts and organization charts, leaving a significant gap in interpreting system architecture diagrams characterized by complex nested semantics. To address this, we propose ADQA, a novel framework designed for hierarchical information extraction and knowledge graph-based reasoning. ADQA introduces a dual-branch semantic extraction mechanism: (1) a position-aware semantic mining module that extracts fine-grained containment and directed relationships to model topological structures; and (2) a color-indexing semantic association module that decodes visual cues into explicit attribute information. These extracted features are integrated to construct a comprehensive knowledge graph (KG), which guides a large language model (LLM) via retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to generate precise, context-aware responses. To facilitate research in this under-explored area, we present ADS, a new benchmark dataset comprising 500 system architecture diagrams and 2,781 expert-annotated question answer pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ADQA significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) multimodal large language models (MLLMs), achieving a 7.41% absolute improvement in F1 score and validating its superior capability in resolving complex visual semantics in system architecture diagrams. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/SDTBU-LCY/ADQA.
